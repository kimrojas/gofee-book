# Pre-compiled DFTB+ via conda

A pre-compiled DFTB+ executable is available in conda-forge via conda installation. 

It can be simply downloaded by

```bash
conda install -n tutorial -c conda-forge 'dftbplus=*=mpi_openmpi_*' dftbplus-tools dftbplus-python
```

Although this is possible, we will be proceeding via the compilation approach.
